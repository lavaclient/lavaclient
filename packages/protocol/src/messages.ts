/**
 * Reason why a track stopped playing.
 *
 * - `finished`
 *   This means that the track itself emitted a terminator. This is usually caused by the track reaching the end,

 *
 * - `loadFailed`
 *   This means that the track failed to start, throwing an exception before providing any audio.
 *
 * - `stopped`
 *   The track was stopped due to the player being stopped by either calling stop() or playTrack(null)
 *
 * - `replaced`
 *   The track stopped playing because a new track started playing. Note that with this reason, the old track will still
 *   play until either its buffer runs out or audio from the new track is available.
 *
 * - `cleanup`
 *   The track was stopped because the cleanup threshold for the audio player was reached. This triggers when the amount
 *   of time passed since the last call to AudioPlayer#provide() has reached the threshold specified in player manager
 *   configuration. This may also indicate either a leaked audio player which was discarded, but not stopped.
